## Description:
MyLittleLab is a web-based particle system inspired by Jeffrey Ventrella's Cluester project. This project aims to implement my own version of that concept using modern web technologies.

The simulation is built with Three.js to create a 2.5D environment, where each cell (or particle) can have different properties such as size, color, and membrane behavior. The system simulates emergent behaviors based on simple interaction rules between groups of particles.

The project uses Node.js for development tooling and leverages several libraries for styling and UI, including Bootstrap and custom CSS.

## Build:

To run the project in development mode, use:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
